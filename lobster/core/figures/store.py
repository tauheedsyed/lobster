"""FigureStore protocol and the local, filesystem-backed authority (contract §1, §2, §6, §9).

Local guarantees: atomic visibility + no-replace through this store (``os.mkdir`` / ``os.link``,
``revision.json`` written last), detection of byte changes on read. Qualified for POSIX local
filesystems. Not a crash-proof journal and no protection against other local code.

Writer lock: every store WRITE (``commit_execution``, ``commit``,
``add_rendition`` and deletion) runs under ONE in-process lock per resolved local store root,
shared by every ``LocalFigureStore`` instance of that root in this process. It protects only
that local copy within ONE process. Local qualification is ONE process per local workspace
directory: there is no cross-process lock (no flock) and no S3, Cloud or other-process claim.
Documented exception: a subprocess worker sharing the same local directory is outside this
qualification (reported OFF); enabling it needs a new decision.
