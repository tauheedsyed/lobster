# Figure templates

Templates are ordinary, versioned Python functions returning editable Plotly
figures. They are not model-facing tools and do not save files, modify datasets,
fit models, or rerun statistical tests.

## Discover and draw

```python
from lobster.figure_templates import get_template, list_templates, show_template_source

list_templates()                       # names, versions, purposes, signatures
show_template_source("proteomics.volcano")  # readable provider code and helpers

fig = get_template("proteomics.volcano@1")(
    retained_de_rows,
    comparison="treated_vs_control",
    fdr=0.05,
    log2fc_min=1.0,                     # LOG2 units, not a linear fold change
    boundary="strict",                 # p < FDR and abs(log2FC) > cutoff
)
fig.update_layout(title="Treated vs control")
fig.add_annotation(text="Custom annotation", x=0, y=1)
```

The volcano filters one explicit comparison and refuses duplicate protein IDs
within it. It changes only the classification shown in the figure, not the
stored DE results or downstream enrichment. `boundary="inclusive"` uses `<=`
for p and `>=` for absolute log2FC. Zero p-values use the explicitly recorded
`p_floor`. Source rows with nonfinite effects or invalid p-values are refused,
not silently removed.

Inside `execute_custom_code`, hand the result to the shared `submit_figure`
helper. Creating a Python variable is not submission. A source must be supplied
explicitly to retain regeneration data; submitting without one does not imply
that the figure can be regenerated. Saving and revision identity belong to the
trusted wrapper, not to a template.

## Inventory

- Core: `generic.scatter`, `line`, `bar`, `histogram`, `box`, `heatmap`,
  `correlation`.
- Proteomics: `proteomics.volcano`, `proteomics.pathway_bubble`.
- Drug discovery: `chem.similarity_heatmap` (a **precomputed** matrix).
- Transcriptomics: `sc.umap`, `violin`, `feature`, `dot`, `heatmap`, `elbow`,
  `cluster_composition`, `qc`.

Single-cell functions use an in-memory AnnData, its stored embedding, and
explicitly selected genes/groups/layers. The QC template requires metrics from
`assess_data_quality`; it never calculates missing metrics or writes `obs`.
Dot plots record the descriptive group means, percent expressing and optional
per-gene z-score settings. Aggregated marks do not claim single-cell selection.

Fingerprint analysis returns a workspace metadata result reference and key.
Read that retained result's `data.analysis.similarity_matrix` and
`data.analysis.compound_ids` for the chemistry template; do not rerun chemistry
just to draw it. The metadata file is mutable workspace content, **not** an
immutable scientific identity. Freeze the full payload explicitly on submission
when a regeneration source is needed.

## Style, identity and recipe

`initialize_house_style()` sets the `omics_os` Plotly default for custom code;
`apply_house_style(fig)` applies the same embedded style to an existing figure.
Every template applies it by default. Users may subsequently change any Plotly
property.

Templates record their name, version and resolved data-free arguments in
`layout.meta.lobster_template`. This is **declared** recipe metadata, not proof
that the figure was produced by that template. Settings must be finite JSON and
fit within 16 KiB; oversized settings are refused rather than truncated. Data
belongs in the source, not template arguments.

Trace `uid`s are stable by semantic class/gene/panel. Individual cell/protein
labels are strings in `customdata[:, 0]`; their entity kind/comparison are in
`trace.meta.lobster_ids`. Their source namespace comes from the saved revision,
not a guessed dataset name or a row position. Without a frozen source they are
labels only, not bound scientific selections. Matrix and aggregate marks have
no single-entity binding.

## Add a provider

A package may ship a uniquely named module beneath the PEP 420 namespace
`lobster.figure_template_providers`. Do not add `__init__.py` there. Expose a
cheap `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST` of descriptors with `name`, `version`, `purpose` and
`callable` (function name), and decorate each callable with `figure_template`.
Keep heavy imports inside drawing functions; discovery should not load a
scientific stack. The decorator's default data argument is `data`; additional
input arrays must be declared with `data_args=(...)` so they are not recorded as
settings.

Each provider needs fixture tests for Plotly validity, input immutability,
style, stable identities and explicit transform/threshold settings. Source code
and a modified returned figure remain available for designs beyond the template.
